title: Getting to Know Me
---


I’m a Financial Engineering graduate student at Cornell University. I’ve been a professional software programmer in the past with an avid interest in Machine Learning. You can access my resume for more details about my background and experience through this link <a href="/public/Dsouza_Joel_Resume.pdf" download>here</a>

I love studying patterns in the stock market and I put my Machine Learning hobby to use in doing the same.

When I’m away from my desk, I’m a fierce FC Barcelona fan and I thoroughly enjoy playing football, cricket, badminton, table tennis and chess. I’m still exploring other sports to add on to my list.
