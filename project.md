<h3>Predicting Cryptocurrency Prices using Machine Learning</h3>
I along with my team worked on predicting bitcoin daily movements and returns using machine learning models using macroeconomic factors, bitcoin related features, google trends and twitter sentiments. Github repository can be found <a href='https://github.com/DN612/Crypto-Analysis' target="_blank" >here</a>


<h3>IAQF Competition 2022</h3>
My team and I worked on identifying the market states and developing a trading strategy based on the market state we are in. Detailed report of our work can be found <a href='./public/IAQF.pdf' download>here</a>


<h3>Oil Price Prediction</h3>
My team and I worked on predicting crude oil prices. We used linear and non-linear machine learning algorithms to analyse and predict returns. Proposed a modified ensemble method that performed better than the ARIMA model used as benchmark by MSE of 0.39. Detailed report of our work can be found <a href='./public/5741_Final_Report.pdf' download>here</a> and the repository can be found on my GitHub


<h3>Sensitivity based Neural Network Explanations for Portfolio Optimizations</h3>
Compared traditional portfolio optimization techniques with neural network implementation(LSTM). Used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanation to interpret the results.
